    "text": "My research is centered at the interface of biodiversity (taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic), ecosystem services, and the conservation and sustainable use of natural resources. I have used various analytical and theoretical approaches combining empirical datasets with remote sensing and modeling to assess how climate change and land use influence species distribution, functional biodiversity, and ecosystem functioning. Besides trying to answer fundamental scientific questions, I am also particularly interested in translate this knowledge to support public policies and business applications while, at the same time, increasing societal benefits fairly and equitably. For instance, questions that I have explored include: what biodiversity and ecosystem metrics can support the assessment and monitoring of Nature-based Solutions (NbSs) by providing a more holistic perspective that not only carbon-centered metrics as currently is done in most of the voluntary carbon markets? what is the potential of green technologies (e.g., Web 3.0, machine learning, remote sensing, and IoT sensors) to provide data mobilization and transparency to support consistent allocation of financial resources to forest conservation?"

    "text": "I am an ecologist with a background in the academic and green tech sectors. I am interested in leveraging nature-based solutions (NbS) and technological innovations for conservation and monitoring biodiversity to enhance the resilience of communities in a changing world. I have developed a framework for monitoring and reporting the impact and dependencies on the nature of companies and portfolios (natural capital accounting). I use an integrative approach combining skills in data science, statistical modeling, geospatial analysis, and natural capital accounting to model and predict biodiversity and ecosystem services. Besides trying to answer fundamental scientific questions, I am also particularly interested in translating this knowledge to support public policies and business applications while, at the same time, increasing societal benefits fairly and equitably. I am committed to fostering diversity and inclusion, specifically focused on underrepresented minorities.\nThanks for checking out my web site!"
