## About

I am an ecologist with a background in the academic and green tech sectors. I am interested in leveraging nature-based solutions (NbS) and technological innovations for conservation and monitoring biodiversity to enhance the resilience of communities in a changing world. I have developed a framework for monitoring and reporting the impact and dependencies on the nature of companies and portfolios (natural capital accounting). I use an integrative approach combining skills in data science, statistical modeling, geospatial analysis, and natural capital accounting to model and predict biodiversity and ecosystem services. Besides trying to answer fundamental scientific questions, I am also particularly interested in translating this knowledge to support public policies and business applications while, at the same time, increasing societal benefits fairly and equitably. I am committed to fostering diversity and inclusion, specifically focused on underrepresented minorities.
